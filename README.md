The Aircraft mod for Factorio

  Factorio is a game about building and managing your ever-growing factory, while defending yourself from the native population that don't
much care you for ruining their planet with pollution. In the late-game, it can be a bit of a chore to get to all your different outposts
and to assault the natives in their distant homes, so I made this mod.

  The aircraft all have their different uses, the jet being primarily used to commute back and forth from distant outposts, the cargo plane 
used to move large amounts of items between far-apart areas, the flying fortress designed to rain hell down upon the natives for daring
to protest your unstoppable pollution, and the gunship, which tries to strike a balance between the other three.

  I also try to make sure that my mod is compatible with other mods. I've got support for some of the larger mods, such as Bob's mods, but
I also attempt to make patches for some of the smaller mods, such as Raven and Helicopters. If there's anything incompatible, let me know
so I can at least try to fix it.
